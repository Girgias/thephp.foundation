            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The initial group of sponsored developers has now been "at it" for a month, and we thought that you might be interested in who they are and what they work on. I got the opportunity to (virtually) sit down with Derick Rethans, George Peter Banyard, Ilija Tovilo, Jakub Zelenka, and Máté Kocsis for an interview.</p>

<h4 id="%2A%2Asebastian%3A%2A%2A-let%27s-start-with-a-round-of-introductions.-who-are-you%3F"><strong>Sebastian:</strong> Let's start with a round of introductions. Who are you?</h4>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Hello, my name is George Peter Banyard. I'm studying pure mathematics at Imperial College London and expected to graduate in October. I'm half German, half British, but grew up in the south of France. During my free time I mostly watch anime or play puzzle games and Richii mahjong.</p>

<p><strong>Derick:</strong> I am originally from the Netherlands but currently living and enjoying London in the United Kingdom. When I am not behind my computer I will be likely be walking in the countryside or site, with my trusty camera to commit these views to screen.</p>

<p><strong>Ilija:</strong>  I am from Bern, Switzerland. I grew up here, but also have roots and relatives in Croatia. When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, being in the sun, and listening to music. I also enjoy solving puzzles and playing chess.</p>

<p><strong>Jakub:</strong> I am originally from Prague. I moved to the UK over 10 years ago. I work as a contractor and spend most of my free time with my family. I have got 2 dogs that I often walk.</p>

<p><strong>Máté:</strong> I am a 31 year old software developer, based in Hungary. Currently, I work for LastPass, and I am responsible for keeping our PHP backend modern as well as bringing it into the cloud. In my free time, I love riding my bike, walking, travelling. But my greatest hobby is certainly programming.</p>

<h4 id="%2A%2Asebastian%3A%2A%2A-what-motivates-you-to-work-on-open-source%3F"><strong>Sebastian:</strong> What motivates you to work on Open Source?</h4>

<p><strong>George:</strong> This might be a strange answer, but I would say laziness. In the sense that if I like something from another project or language, I prefer going through the effort of adding that as a feature to what I already know and use instead of learning a whole new tool and ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Ilija:</strong> Almost all commercial software is built on Open Source. I think that without Open Source, most tech companies could not exist as they do today. Contributing to Open Source is a way for me to give back for the professional opportunities Open Source has given me.</p>

<p><strong>Jakub:</strong> Working on Open Source gives me opportunities to learn new things in a useful way and allows me to give back something to the projects that I use.</p>

<p><strong>Derick:</strong> Originally it was a great way to learn how to do new things. Most of my early contributions to PHP were things that I needed myself. I have since then continued to scratch my own itch(es), but that has also resulted in me having to maintain some of the more popular projects, such as Xdebug.</p>

<p><strong>Máté:</strong> My first "major" open source contribution was a tiny little feature in Composer. Then I created a few libraries which also gained some traction. Even considering the limited scale my projects achieved, it was a fantastic experience for me that I did my share to improve the PHP ecosystem, and at least a few people found my work useful. In contrast, being able to improve PHP itself day by day may make the life of millions of developers better, which is a truly satisfying feeling.</p>

<h4 id="%2A%2Asebastian%3A%2A%2A-what-was-your-first-contribution-to-php%3F"><strong>Sebastian:</strong> What was your first contribution to PHP?</h4>

<p><strong>Máté:</strong> I have been using PHP since I was 15, and I'm a longtime PHP internals reader. Since finding the mailing list, I have always dreamed about being able to contribute to PHP, even if it is a tiny little change. Then fast-forward to 2019, when Nikita started the so-called "<a href="https://externals.io/message/106522">stubs initiative</a>". This was a perfect project to get started with my career. By submitting hundreds of PRs, I could learn a lot from Nikita and Christoph, among others, who tirelessly reviewed my code and helped when I was stuck.</p>

<p><strong>Derick:</strong> Back in 2000, I first tried to add "sub query" support for MySQL. MySQL's query language did not support it, and I came up with a naive way of rewriting the query in C, by doing two queries. My first actual contribution was SWF support in the getimagesize() function, followed by adding libmcrypt 2.4 support to the mcrypt extension, which I also ended up mostly rewriting.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> I first started by contributing to the French translation of the PHP documentation before working on the English docs and making my way to php-src to change some very strange behaviour I discovered while maintaining the docs.</p>

<p><strong>Ilija:</strong> I have been using PHP professionally for 6 years at that point and contributing has crossed my mind a few times. However, most features I could think of seemed daunting, especially since I did not have any experience with C. Then I saw this <a href="https://twitter.com/nikita_ppv/status/1240309838950866946">tweet</a> from Nikita about how <code>throw</code> could be changed to be allowed in expressions. Being bored in the early COVID-19 days, I was looking for a distraction. This seemed simple enough so I gave it a shot. The actual change was a one-liner but there were issues with OpCache which required help from Nikita and others to solve (recurring theme). Nonetheless, this was enough to pull me in and motivate me to keep making RFCs.</p>

<p><strong>Jakub:</strong> I used to work as a PHP developer and came across an extension for PHP called fann. As it did not really work, I refactored the whole extension. That taught me a bit about PHP's internals. Some time later I wanted to properly learn tools such as bison and re2c. At that time, there was a need for a new JSON parser for PHP due to licensing issues. So I wrote a new JSON parser and became a PHP core contributor.</p>

<h4 id="%2A%2Asebastian%3A%2A%2A-what-do-you-plan-to-work-on-in-your-time-that-is-sponsored-by-the-php-foundation%3F"><strong>Sebastian:</strong> What do you plan to work on in your time that is sponsored by The PHP Foundation?</h4>

<p><strong>Máté:</strong> First, I would like to finish my projects which I have already started: readonly classes (needs a successful RFC vote), converting resources to objects, adding constants to the stubs, and doing other groundwork for making our documentation more complete and easier to maintain. Then my plan is to improve the developer experience of the built-in extensions as well as continuing our efforts to make PHP a more consistent and reasonable language.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> I plan to mainly work on the type system as well as refactoring extension code for clarity. For example, I want to continue the effort of converting resources to opaque objects.</p>

<p><strong>Ilija:</strong> I have a few things that I would like to try to tackle: abstract data types, property accessors, type aliases, to name a few. My biggest goal is gaining a deep understanding of the code base (<a href="https://blog.krakjoe.ninja/2021/05/avoiding-busses.html">increasing the bus factor</a>), helping with maintenance, and helping others to the same.</p>

<p><strong>Jakub:</strong> I plan to primarily work on the maintenance and improvements in the areas that I have already been contributing to. Specifically, I would like to use roughly around 50% of my time on the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM), 20% on the OpenSSL extension, 10% on the JSON extension, 10% on the GnuPG extension, and the last 10% on streams as well as possibly other core parts.</p>

<p><strong>Derick:</strong> To begin, I want to clean up all the date/time bugs and reports, dedicate time to fully understanding and assisting new RFCs, professionalising "security@", doing all the server admin tasks, and coming up with some new features such as perhaps a UString (Unicode String) class with all of its operations to have a much nicer interface compared to the clunky intl extension.</p>

<p><strong>Sebastian:</strong> Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I look forward to seeing your work make PHP better for everyone.</p>

            <link href="/blog/2022/05/02/the-php-foundation-update-april-2022/"/>
            <updated>2022-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2022/05/02/the-php-foundation-update-april-2022/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>&lt;?php echo 'Hello world!';</code></p>

<p>We’re off by two but still happy to bring you an update from the foundation.</p>

<p>It's been a month since the PHP Foundation began to fully deliver on its 2022 goal of hiring developers to work on the PHP core.</p>

<p>Backed by our awesome sponsors, six talented folks have already been doing their work for a whole month. Derick Rethans, Arnaud Le Blanc, George Peter Banyard, Jakub Zelenka, and Máté Kocsis started on April 1, and Ilija Tovilo started even earlier than that.</p>

<p>We’ve made the first <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation/expenses">payouts</a>, and we will continue making them regularly at the end of each month.</p>

<h2 id="how-were-the-devs-selected%2C-and-how-do-they-work%3F">How were the devs selected, and how do they work?</h2>

<p>We received about 70 applications in total. From them, we selected everyone who had significant experience making <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php-src</a> contributions.</p>

<p>We also now have a pool of a few other candidates, and we will consider involving them later.</p>

<p>All of the current developers are working part time, and everyone has different working hours. The developers devote 10–40% of their time exclusively to PHP core maintenance, bug fixes, code reviews, preparing proposals, and implementing new language features.</p>

<p>You can follow the Foundation team's work in real-time by looking at <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commits/master">commits in php/php-src</a> and discussions in the <a href="https://externals.io/">Internals mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the PHP Foundation team, even more work on the PHP core is being done by Dmitry Stogov, Christoph M. Becker, and many other contributors to core and documentation. We’d like to give a big shout-out and thank-you to them!</p>

<h2 id="php-roundup">PHP Roundup</h2>

<p>We have started a separate <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/">PHP Roundup</a> newsletter that covers the development of the PHP core in more detail. Ayesh Karunaratne, the author of the <a href="https://php.watch/">PHP.Watch</a> website, is leading this initiative.</p>

<p>Check it out and subscribe at <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/">thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-picture-and-roadmap">Bigger picture and roadmap</h2>

<p>Some folks have asked us whether there is a roadmap for PHP. The short answer is ‘No’. But we’d be happy to grow to the point where we can have one.</p>

<p>The problem the Foundation was created to address will not be solved overnight simply because the funds become available. While PHP is in a better position than it has ever been in terms of financing, this doesn't do much to improve the bus factor. In other words, financing alone is not able to increase the availability of the expertise needed to execute the kinds of projects that would appear on a roadmap.</p>

<p>Financing allows us to cultivate expertise organically, which results in increasing the bus factor. That is precisely what we are currently doing. The only way to become an expert in PHP is by doing PHP. We are essentially paying contributors to become the kind of experts we will need in the future while at the same time compensating them for their valuable contributions in the present.</p>

<p>It has taken us six months to get this far. And there'll be a time, quite soon, when we can talk more extensively about the future.</p>

<h2 id="website-%E2%80%93-thephp.foundation">Website – <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">thephp.foundation</a></h2>

<p>Thanks to the work of Matthew Weier O'Phinney, the foundation’s official website is now up and running. On its <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/">blog</a>, you can find all the updates and the PHP Roundup series.</p>

<p>The site is open source and is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation">github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation</a>.</p>

<p>It is made with the Sculpin static generator and uses Tailwind CSS. There are some <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation/issues">known issues</a>, and pull requests with fixes and improvements are welcome.</p>

<p>We will add pages about the foundation's structure and team shortly.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-to-our-sponsors">Thank you to our sponsors</h2>

<p>We’d like to give a shout-out to everyone for your continued support, we truly appreciate it – the PHP Foundation is all of us!</p>

<p>That’s all for today. Follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thephpf">@ThePHPF</a> to get the latest updates from the Foundation.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first <em>PHP Roundup</em>, where we’ll make regular updates on the improvements made to PHP by the <em>PHP Foundation</em> and other contributors. PHP Roundup is prepared by Ayesh Karunaratne from <strong><a href="https://php.watch">PHP.Watch</a></strong>, a source for PHP news and articles on upcoming changes.</p>

<p>In this series, we highlight some of the interesting and major improvements made to the PHP language. Traditionally, the PHP team releases a new minor version of the interpreter towards the end of each year, but the changes and improvements are discussed and implemented throughout the year.</p>

<p>You don’t necessarily have to be a PHP Foundation backer to follow the PHP Roundup. We’ll be publishing the posts on our website, and you can subscribe to a newsletter:</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation currently supports six part-time PHP contributors who work on both maintenance and new features for PHP. Maintenance is not limited to fixing bugs, but also includes work to reduce technical debt, making life easier for everyone working on PHP. The contributors funded by the PHP Foundation collaborate with other contributors on code, documentation, and discussions.</p>

<p>Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<p>Let’s get straight to the updates.</p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<p>Every major change to PHP is discussed and implemented with the consensus of the PHP community. Each RFC proposes a set of changes, and the PHP Internals community holds a vote that lasts two weeks by default.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null-false-standalone-types">Allow null and false as stand-alone types</a> 💜</strong></p>

<p>RFC by George Peter Banyard was accepted unanimously with all 38 votes in favor and is now merged into PHP.</p>

<p>Prior to this change, <code>null</code>and <code>false</code>could only be used as part of a Union Type, but not as stand-alone types. This change further improves PHP’s type system to be more expressive and defensive. See the <code>true</code> type RFC below that proposes adding <code>true</code>as a type too.</p>

<p>Learn more about this RFC from the <a href="https://phpinternals.news/99">PHP Internals News podcast</a> hosted by Derick Rethans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/redact_parameters_in_back_traces">Redacting parameters in back traces</a></strong></p>

<p>RFC by Tim Düsterhus, approved with 24:1 votes in favor, is now implemented in PHP core.</p>

<p>This RFC proposed adding a <code>#[SensitiveParameter]</code> attribute that redacts the parameter's actual value when it is spewed out in stack traces and <code>var_dump</code>output. The attribute can be used to prevent leaking sensitive information in debugging logs.</p>

<p>Learn more about this RFC from the <a href="https://phpinternals.news/97">PHP Internals News podcast</a> hosted by Derick Rethans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/true-type">Add true type</a> 💜</strong></p>

<p>RFC by George Peter Banyard is currently under discussion, to add true as a type to PHP. In PHP 8.0 Union Types, we added <code>false</code> as one of the possible members of Union Types, but left out <code>true</code>. This RFC proposes to complete it by adding <code>true</code> as a type as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/undefined_variable_error_promotion">Undefined Variable Error Promotion</a></strong></p>

<p>RFC by Mark Randall accepted with 33:8 votes in favor.</p>

<p>This proposes to convert the current behavior of PHP raising a warning for accessing an undefined variable (PHP 8.0+) to throw an Error exception instead in PHP 9.0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/undefined_property_error_promotion">Undefined Property Error Promotion</a></strong></p>

<p>Another RFC by Mark Randall proposes to throw an error on undefined class property access, similar to the now accepted changes with undefined variables. Notably, PHP 8.2 already emits deprecation notices on dynamic property creation (<a href="https://php.watch/versions/8.2/dynamic-properties-deprecated#exempt">with a few exceptions</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readonly_classes">Readonly classes</a> 💜</strong></p>

<p>RFC by Máté Kocsis proposes to add support for readonly classes. In such a class, all properties are <code>readonly</code>and dynamic properties are forbidden. Voting is scheduled to start on April 27th.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_dollar_brace_string_interpolation">Deprecate ${} string interpolation</a> 💜</strong></p>

<p>RFC by Ilija Tovilo accepted with 31:1 votes in favor.</p>

<p>This RFC proposes to deprecate <code>"${foo}"</code> and "<code>${(foo)}</code>" string interpolation patterns. It does <em>not</em> deprecate the standard "<code>{$foo}</code>" pattern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_utf8_decode_and_utf8_encode">Deprecate and Remove utf8_encode and utf8_decode</a></strong></p>

<p>Learn more about this RFC from the <a href="https://phpinternals.news/98">PHP Internals News podcast</a> hosted by Derick Rethans.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="merged-prs-and-commits">Merged PRs and Commits</h2>

<p>Some of the minor changes made to PHP are first made as a pull request to the <a href="github.com/php/php-src">PHP GitHub project</a>, and if deemed acceptable by PHP core maintainers, they are merged without going through a formal RFC process. We have automatic tests in place to flag PRs that break existing functionality. The majority of the minor changes from the community are made through PRs.</p>

<p>We promised to publish monthly updates, but something everything went wrong in February.</p>

<p>Thank you all for being understanding about the lack of update in February. This post will bring you all up to date on everything that's been accomplished since our last post in January.</p>

<h3 id="php-foundation-core-developers">PHP Foundation Core Developers</h3>

<p>One of our primary goals for 2022 is to find and hire developers to work on the core.</p>

<p>We are excited to reveal our initial group of sponsored developers!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arnaud Le Blanc</strong> <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a></li>
<li><strong>Derick Rethans</strong> <a href="https://github.com/derickr">@derickr</a></li>
<li><strong>George Peter Banyard</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Girgias">@Girgias</a></li>
<li><strong>Ilija Tovilo</strong> <a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">@iluuu1994</a></li>
<li><strong>Jakub Zelenka</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bukka">@bukka</a></li>
<li><strong>Máté Kocsis</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">@kocsismate</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You might be surprised to see Derick Rethans’ name in the list above. After all, he was listed as a PHP Fellow when we announced the Foundation last year. Shortly after we launched the Foundation, Derick informed us of his desire to focus his work on developing and maintaining PHP's core and that he wanted to apply for sponsorship from the Foundation to make this happen. To avoid any conflicts of interest, Derick stepped down from his administrative role before he applied for sponsorship.</p>

<p>We are incredibly happy that these core developers have agreed to join the Foundation, and we are looking forward to the great things we can do together.</p>

<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>All participants of the PHP Foundation including administration members and developers are expected to abide by the <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contributor-covenant.org%2Fversion%2F2%2F1%2Fcode_of_conduct%2F">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>To ensure enforcement of the Code of Conduct we are setting up a dedicated team. Tobias Nyholm <a href="https://github.com/Nyholm">@Nyholm</a>, who leads <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsymfony.com%2Fcare">Symfony’s CARE team</a>, will be responsible for assembling and running the Foundation’s CoC team. Welcome aboard, Tobias!</p>

<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next</h3>

<p>Our main goal for the next month is to set up a proper communication and development process. We will conduct several meetings to discuss technical and organizational matters.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of the Foundation is to train the next generation of internal developers, we want to emphasize maintenance and user-focused features to maximize our impact. As such, we will review the efforts and ensure the plans fall in line with such an agenda.</p>

<p>We would also like to reduce the bus factor of PHP. So whenever possible, developers will be expected to update the <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phpinternalsbook.com%2F">PHP Internals Book</a> to ensure that no knowledge is lost.</p>

<p>On the administration side, we plan to work on increasing the transparency of our operations: to shed some light on the governance structure, discussions, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="php-foundation-stands-with-ukraine-%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%A6">PHP Foundation stands with Ukraine 🇺🇦</h3>

<p>On February 24th, 2022, Vladimir Putin's Regime began an illegal war of aggression in Ukraine. There are no words to truly express our outrage at such disregard for human life.</p>

<p>Many PHP developers have lived in or are living in Ukraine, and the PHP Foundation is supported by many backers from Ukraine, including sponsors <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Foroinc.com%2Flets-stop-the-war-together%2F">Oro, Inc.</a> and <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacpaw.com%2F">MacPaw</a>.</p>

<p>If you, like many in the PHP Foundation, are desperate to find a way to help, there are some organizations listed below that are working to provide humanitarian aid to people who are caught up in this war.</p>

<p>We are proud that many of our sponsors stand with Ukraine too. Here are just a few examples:</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>&lt;?php echo 'Hello world!';</code></p>

<p>In November, the PHP Foundation was launched publicly and we’ve seen enormous support from the community.
Thanks to all of you who have already supported the initiative! We’re planning to update you about our workstream activities on a monthly basis, and this is our first update post.
Let’s take a look at what we’ve been working on!</p>

<h3 id="the-first-round-of-applications-is-now-closed">The first round of applications is now closed</h3>

<p>Since November, many developers have applied for sponsorship, and there were quite a few that we would be very happy to sponsor.</p>

<p>We are discussing the details with applicants and planning the budget.
In order to organize this correctly we need proper documents and agreements.
The JetBrains legal department and OpenCollective staff are helping us to prepare the required paperwork.</p>

<p>We plan to complete the preparations and sign the necessary documents in January.
After that, we will announce the list of the first batch of sponsored developers.</p>

<h3 id="how-we%E2%80%99re-making-decisions">How we’re making decisions</h3>

<p>So far, we have held three administration meetings where we discussed the pressing issues.
Each meeting and the decision-making process are documented in our organization on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/thephpf">github.com/thephpf</a>.
For now the details are hidden, but we would like to make these meetings and notes public at some point.</p>

<p>In the next few months, we plan to hold biweekly meetings and work on the foundation’s governance, rules, and bylaws.</p>

<h3 id="shout-out-to-our-sponsors">Shout out to our sponsors</h3>
